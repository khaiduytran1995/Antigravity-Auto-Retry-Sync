# Walkthrough - Updated Zalo Invitation Links

I have updated the Zalo invitation links in the application to point to the new community group.

## Changes

### Assets

#### [index-4fJAQxCc.js](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/resources/app/dist/assets/index-4fJAQxCc.js)

Updated the Zalo link from the old ID to the new one.

```diff
- https://zalo.me/g/deedjm305
+ https://zalo.me/g/kyyyuo618
```

#### [index-4fJAQxCc.js (Decompiled)](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/decompiled/dist/assets/index-4fJAQxCc.js)

Applied the same update to the decompiled version of the asset.

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
- Performed a grep search for the old link `deedjm305` and confirmed it no longer exists in the target files.
- Performed a grep search for the new link `kyyyuo618` and confirmed its presence in both updated files.

### Manual Verification
- Inspected the code at the specific lines (line 885 in both files) to ensure the replacement was clean and correctly formatted.
