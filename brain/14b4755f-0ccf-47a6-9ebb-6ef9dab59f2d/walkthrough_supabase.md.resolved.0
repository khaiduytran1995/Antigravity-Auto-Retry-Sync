# Walkthrough: Supabase Auth Integration

I have integrated a professional Login/Register interface into Veo Automation.

## Features Added

### 1. Premium Auth Interface
- **Glassmorphism Design**: High-end translucent UI overlay with blur effects.
- **Responsive Animations**: Smooth sliding and fading transitions.
- **Hybrid View**: The main application remains hidden (`display: none`) until a user successfully authenticates.

### 2. Supabase Logic
- **Full Auth Lifecycle**: Supports both email/password Login and Register.
- **Session Persistence**: Users stay logged in across app restarts thanks to Supabase session management.
- **Remote Protection**: Access to the bypassed generation features is now behind your own Supabase project.

## ⚠️ Final Step: Adding Credentials

To make the login work, you need to add your Supabase credentials. 

### Option 1: Tell me the keys
You can simply paste the **URL** and **Anon Key** here in the chat, and I will update the files for you.

### Option 2: Edit manually
Open [supabase-auth.js](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/resources/app/dist/supabase-auth.js) and replace the placeholders:
```javascript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL_HERE';
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_HERE';
```
