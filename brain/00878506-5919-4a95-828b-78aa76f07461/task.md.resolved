# JSON Cookies Import + Login Persistence Fix

- [x] Add fetchTokenFromCookie to tokenManager.js
- [x] Add addAccountFromCookie to tokenManager.js  
- [x] Create cookieIpc.js with auth:add-from-cookie handler
- [ ] Restore main.js from backup (injection caused duplication)
- [ ] Test integration

## Notes
- main.js is obfuscated - direct injection duplicated content
- cookieIpc.js needs to be required by main.js to work
- User should manually restore main.js.backup and add require at end
