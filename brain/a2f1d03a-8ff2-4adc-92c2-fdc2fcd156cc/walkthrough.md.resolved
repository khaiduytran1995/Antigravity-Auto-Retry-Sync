# Emergency Fixes Applied 🛠️

## Issue #1: Infinite Recovery Loops
**Root Cause**: The `isRecovering` lock was not released when the "Progressive Cooldown" check threw an error. This left the lock in a stuck state.
**Fix**: Added `this.isRecovering = false;` before throwing the cooldown error in [tokenManager.js](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/decompiled/dist-electron/services/tokenManager.js).

## Issue #2: `(intermediate value) is not a function`
**Root Cause**: My previous refactoring accidentally deleted the `requests` array initialization in [flowImage.js](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/decompiled/dist-electron/services/flowImage.js).
**Fix**: Restored the missing loop that creates the `requests` array:
```javascript
const requests = [];
for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(count, 4); i++) {
    requests.push({ ... });
}
```

## Status
All critical fixes have been applied. Please restart the application and test again.
