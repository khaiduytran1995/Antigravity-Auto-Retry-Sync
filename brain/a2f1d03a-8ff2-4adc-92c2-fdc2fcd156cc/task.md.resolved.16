# Task: Debugging "includes" error and Lag in Veo Automation

- [x] Analyze [flowVideo.js](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/decompiled/dist-electron/services/flowVideo.js) and identify the crash point.

- [x] Check [main.js](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/decompiled/dist-electron/main.js) and [main_fixed.js](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/Filegocdeupdate/Veo%20Automation/resources/app/dist-electron/main_fixed.js) for initialization and integrity checks.
- [x] Debug the `SECRET_CONFIG` issue.
    - [x] Create implementation plan (approved).
    - [x] Add robust fallbacks and detailed logs to [flowVideo.js](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/decompiled/dist-electron/services/flowVideo.js).
    - [x] Add robust fallbacks and detailed logs to [flowImage.js](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/decompiled/dist-electron/services/flowImage.js).
    - [x] Add robust fallbacks and detailed logs to [flowImageUpscale.js](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/decompiled/dist-electron/services/flowImageUpscale.js).
- [x] Resolve Lag and Timeout issues (Execution).
    - [x] Implement Serial reCAPTCHA queue in [tokenManager.js](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/decompiled/dist-electron/services/tokenManager.js).
    - [x] Optimize hardware simulation in [tokenManager.js](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/decompiled/dist-electron/services/tokenManager.js).
    - [x] Finalize logging and fallbacks in [flowVideo.js](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/decompiled/dist-electron/services/flowVideo.js).
- [x] Final verification and walkthrough creation.
- [x] Implement persistent file logging for troubleshooting.
- [x] Fix cross-account interference typo and improve reCAPTCHA trust scores.
- [x] Add random human-like delays (3-8s) to avoid bot detection.
- [x] Add 60-second recovery cooldown to prevent infinite retry loops.
- [x] Phase: Thorough Stabilization & "Zero-Fail" Session Management
    - [x] Implement Synchronous Multi-Call Guard in [tokenManager.js](file:///d:/14012026Veo%20Automation%20Setup%201.2.1/$PLUGINSDIR/decompiled/dist-electron/services/tokenManager.js).
    - [x] Add Graceful `ERR_ABORTED` handling for navigations.
    - [x] Implement Progressive Backoff (60s -> 300s) for recovery.
    - [x] Refine reCAPTCHA "Humanity" script and wait logic.
- [x] Phase: Atomic Shield & Error-Aware Polling
    - [x] Implement Atomic Sync Locking (Immediate set).
    - [x] Refactor `mimicApiCall` to strictly reject during recovery.
    - [x] Add 3s Settling Delay post-recovery.
    - [x] Update `flowVideo`/`flowImage` to handle RECOVERY_IN_PROGRESS errors.
- [/] Phase: Refined Task Isolation (5s/30s Rule)
    - [ ] Update `TokenManager` with `lastStartTime` and `lastFinishTime`.
    - [ ] Implement Smart Overlap: 30s max wait for running, 5s wait for success.
    - [ ] Ensure `flowVideo` and `flowImage` use the refined lock.
