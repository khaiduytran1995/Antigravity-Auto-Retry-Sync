# Zero-Fail Stabilization: Atomic Shield & Task Isolation 🛡️

I have completed the final stabilization phase. The system now includes two major layers of protection to ensure your accounts stay safe and your generation process remains steady.

## 1. Atomic Shield (Session Recovery) 🔒
- **Atomic Locking**: The second a recovery starts, all other calls are blocked. No race conditions.
- **Strict Rejection**: While logging in, the app rejects new API requests to allow the browser to focus 100% on the login process.
- **Auto-Wait**: Generation services will "wait and retry" if they see a recovery is in progress.

## 2. Task Isolation & Cooldown (Per Account) ⏸️
- **1 Command Per Account**: I have implemented a strict lock. Each account will now process **strictly 1 request at a time**.
- **Mandatory 30s Rest**: After a video or image is successfully generated, the account is forced to "rest" for **30 seconds**. This mimics human behavior and prevents Google from flagging your account for bot-like activity.
- **Smart Queueing**: If you send multiple prompts to the same account, they will now wait in line and process one-by-one with the 30s gap between them.

## Verification Logs:
- `🔒 Generation lock active. Waiting...` (Prompt is waiting its turn).
- `✅ Task complete. Mandatory 30s COOLDOWN started...` (Account is resting).
- `🔓 Cooldown finished. Account ready for next task.` (Back to work).

## How to use:
Just continue using the app as normal. These protections are built-in and automatic. You will notice that tasks now process sequentially per account, ensuring maximum stability.

If you see the 30s cooldown in the logs, please do not worry—it is working exactly as requested to protect your accounts.
