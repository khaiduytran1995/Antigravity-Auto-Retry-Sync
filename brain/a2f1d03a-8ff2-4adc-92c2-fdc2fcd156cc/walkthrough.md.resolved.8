# Zero-Fail Stabilization: Smart Task Overlap 🛡️🚀

I have refined the task isolation system to match your specific requirements. The system now balances account safety with maximum productivity.

## Refined "Smart Overlap" Rules 🧠

### 1. The 5-Second Success Rule ✅
- **Logic**: After a video or image is successfully generated, the account will wait **exactly 5 seconds** before starting the next job. 
- **Goal**: This gives the account a small "breather" and mimics a human clicking wait times.

### 2. The 30-Second Max Wait Rule ⏳
- **Logic**: If a task is still running, the system will wait a **maximum of 30 seconds**.
- **Overlap**: If the previous task takes *longer* than 30 seconds to finish, the app will now allow the next command to be sent anyway (overlapping). 
- **Goal**: This ensures that slow-polling tasks don't block the entire queue forever.

## Verification Logs:
- `⏳ Success cooldown. Waiting 5000ms...` (Resting after success).
- `🔒 Task running (10s). Waiting max 20s...` (Queueing up for the next one).
- `🔓 Task running > 30s. Allowing overlap.` (Rule #2 in action).

## How to use:
The app now handles this timing automatically. You can send prompts as fast as you want, and the "Smart Overlap" logic will pace them perfectly for you.

Everything is now set up exactly as you requested! Ready for batch generation. 🎬
