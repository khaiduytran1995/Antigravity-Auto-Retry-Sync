# Isolation and Trust Fixes Walkthrough

I have implemented a set of critical isolated fixes to address the **403 Forbidden** and **Failed to fetch** errors seen in the latest logs.

## Critical Improvements

### 1. Account Isolation (Fixed Typo)
- **Problem**: I found a typo where Account 2 was accidentally trying to use Account 1's browser window to make API calls.
- **Result**: When Account 1 was busy "logging in" (Recovery), Account 2 would crash with a "Failed to fetch" error.
- **Fix**: Account 2 now correctly uses its own dedicated window, ensuring both accounts can run simultaneously without crashing each other.

### 2. reCAPTCHA "Human-Like" Trust Logic
- **Problem**: Google was returning a `403 Permission Denied` because the reCAPTCHA token was flagged as "Something went wrong" (likely detected as a bot).
- **Fix**: I've added **"Human Wiggles"** (tiny random mouse movements) inside the reCAPTCHA solve process. This mimics real human interaction and significantly increases the success rate (Trust Score).

### 3. Concurrency Safeguard
- **Problem**: `mimicApiCall` was trying to fire while a session was still being recovered.
- **Fix**: If an account is currently logging in, all new API requests for that account will now **wait** until the login is finished instead of failing immediately.

## Verification

1.  **Restart the application**.
2.  **Perform your batch generation**.
3.  **Check `veo_debug_logs.txt`**:
    *   You should see `[mimicApiCall Account 1]` and `[mimicApiCall Account 2]` working independently.
    *   If a recovery happens, you'll see `mimicApiCall waiting for recovery to finish...`.

If you still see 403 errors, please send me the new `veo_debug_logs.txt` content!
