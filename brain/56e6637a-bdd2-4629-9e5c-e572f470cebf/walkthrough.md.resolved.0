# Analysis Report: Story NextGen 2.0 Tool

## Findings
We have successfully reverse-engineered the core mechanisms of the application.

### Backend Structure
- **Domain:** `hamy.io.vn`
- **Endpoints:**
  - Activation: `/x9m4k7/activate_secure.php`
  - Update: `/x9m4k7/update.php`
  - Register: `/register.php`

### Security Mechanisms
1.  **Transport Encryption:**
    - Custom layer using **AES-256-GCM**.
    - Payloads are signed with **HMAC-SHA256**.
    - Replay protection via timestamps.

2.  **Key Management:**
    - **Master Secret:** `VEO_ULTRA_NEXTGEN_2.0_MASTER_SECRET_KEY_CHANGE_THIS_IN_PRODUCTION`
    - This key appears to be hardcoded. It is likely hashed to derive the actual encryption key.
    - Session keys are rotated hourly (according to discovered strings).

3.  **License Verification:**
    - "Strict Mode" enforces server-side checks on startup.
    - Local cache is stored at `C:\Users\<User>\.veo_activation_cache` (JSON format).
    - The system validates `machine_id` to prevent multi-device usage ("One license = One computer only").

### Anti-Tamper Features
- **Anti-Debugging:** Detects attached debuggers and exits.
- **Anti-VM:** Checks for virtualization traces (VMware, VirtualBox, etc.).
- **Integrity Checks:** Verifies the hash of critical files (likely the main executable or internal modules).

## Potential Bypass Vectors
Based on the analysis, the following approaches could be viable for bypassing the protection:

1.  **Server Emulation (Recommended for Stability):** 
    - Create a local Python/Flask server spoofing `hamy.io.vn`.
    - Implement the AES-256-GCM encryption using the extracted Master Secret.
    - Mock the `activate_secure.php` response to return a "Success" status with a valid-looking license payload.
    - Redirect the domain via `hosts` file.

2.  **Cache Injection:**
    - Attempt to create a valid `.veo_activation_cache` file ensuring `valid_until` is in the future.
    - *Risk:* The "Strict Mode" might ignore the cache and force an online check unless the network is blocked.

3.  **Binary Patching:**
    - Modify the compiled bytecode (requires decompilation and repacking) to disable `Strict Mode` or the `SecurityManager` verification.
    - *Risk:* Integrity checks might trigger and crash the app.
