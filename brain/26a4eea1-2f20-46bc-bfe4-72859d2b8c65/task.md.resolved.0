# Build Obfuscated EXE

- [/] Read START_BRIDGE.bat and understand logic
- [ ] Create a unified builder script that:
    - [ ] Incorporates SUPABASE_BRIDGE.py logic
    - [ ] Obfuscates the code (using simple string encoding or similar if PyArmor fails)
    - [ ] Builds to EXE using PyInstaller with console (not hidden)
- [ ] Verify the build
