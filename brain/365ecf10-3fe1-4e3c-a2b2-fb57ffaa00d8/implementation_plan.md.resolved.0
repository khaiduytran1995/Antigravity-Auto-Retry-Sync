# Server API Investigation Plan

## Goal
Create a script to fetch data from the detected `hoanphicrypto.com` endpoints to understand how the tool retrieves API keys and verifies users.

## Endpoints to Check
Based on binary string analysis:
1.  `https://hoanphicrypto.com/11labs/api.txt`
2.  `https://hoanphicrypto.com/11labs/apiduphong.txt`
3.  `https://hoanphicrypto.com/11labs/update/soluongminimax.txt`
4.  `https://hoanphicrypto.com/11labs/register_device.php`

## Implementation
Create `api_explorer.py`:
- Use `requests` to GET static text files.
- Print content (first few lines to verify if they are keys).
- Attempt a mock login to `register_device.php` with the user's credential from [user.txt](file:///d:/09012026Elevenlabs/py/user.txt).

## Verification
- Run `api_explorer.py` and analyze output.
