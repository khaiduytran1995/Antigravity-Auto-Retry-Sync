# Walkthrough: Restoring Real Connection

I have created tools to restore the real connection for Chichbong Image and ensure it no longer uses the bypass proxy or host blocking.

## Changes Made

### Restoration Scripts

1. **[RESTORE_CONNECTION.bat](file:///d:/chichbong_image/RESTORE_CONNECTION.bat)**
   - Removes `api.chichbong.me` and `11labs.net` from the Windows `hosts` file.
   - Requires Administrator privileges.
   - Pings the real API to verify connectivity.

2. **[RUN_NORMAL.bat](file:///d:/chichbong_image/RUN_NORMAL.bat)**
   - Launches [chichbong_generator.exe](file:///d:/chichbong_image/chichbong_generator.exe) directly without the proxy server.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Removing Host Redirections
Run [RESTORE_CONNECTION.bat](file:///d:/chichbong_image/RESTORE_CONNECTION.bat) as Administrator. It will clean up the `hosts` file and test the connection.

### 2. Running the Tool
Use [RUN_NORMAL.bat](file:///d:/chichbong_image/RUN_NORMAL.bat) to start the application. It will now connect directly to the official servers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since the tool now connects to the real server, you will need a valid license or account as required by the official service.
