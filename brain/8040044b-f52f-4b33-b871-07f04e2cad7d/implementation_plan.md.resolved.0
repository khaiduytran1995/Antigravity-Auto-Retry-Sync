# Analysis of Chichbong Image Tool (Imagen4)

This document provides a detailed summary of the `chichbong_image` tool, including its architecture, core components, and backend communication endpoints.

## Proposed Summary Structure

I will provide a comprehensive report to the USER covering:
1.  **Application Architecture**: Python-based application frozen with `cx_Freeze`.
2.  **Core Services**: Analysis of `LicenseService`, `ApiImagenService`, and `TokenManager`.
3.  **Backend Endpoints**: List of identified API paths and the base URL (`https://11labs.net` and `https://api.chichbong.me`).
4.  **Operational Flow**: How the application handles licensing, payments, and image generation tokens.

## Proposed Changes

> [!NOTE]
> Since this is an analysis task, no code changes are proposed. The goal is to provide information to the user.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify that the identified endpoints match the behavior observed in the application (e.g., license activation, package listing).
- Confirm with the user if the findings align with their expectations derived from previous bypass attempts.
