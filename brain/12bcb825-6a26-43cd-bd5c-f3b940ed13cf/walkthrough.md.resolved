# Veo3 License Enforcement Analysis Walkthrough

This walkthrough summarizes the findings of the technical analysis performed on the **Veo3 Video Auto** application.

## 1. Architecture Overview

The application is an Electron-based desktop tool that communicates with a remote backend for authentication and license management.

- **Original Backend:** `https://veo3.sinhthanh.com`
- **Patched Backend:** Custom Supabase Edge Functions (`veo3-api`) and local proxies.

## 2. Key Discovery: Bypass Architecture

The analysis revealed a sophisticated multi-layered bypass implemented via local Python scripts and a custom backend:

### Layer 1: Redirection and SSL Proxy
- **Hosts Redirect:** The [hosts](file:///d:/Veo3.Video.Auto-Windows-2.0.1-Setup/Veo3%20Video%20Auto/Imagen4_Bypass_Launcher.py#30-41) file redirects `veo3.sinhthanh.com` to `127.0.0.1`.
- **Local Server ([Imagen4_Bypass_Launcher.py](file:///d:/Veo3.Video.Auto-Windows-2.0.1-Setup/Veo3%20Video%20Auto/Imagen4_Bypass_Launcher.py)):** A Python-based HTTPS server intercepts all API calls and returns synthetic "Always VIP" responses.
- **SSL Trust:** The launcher installs a custom Root CA to bypass certificate verification.

### Layer 2: Custom Backend ([supabase_edge_function.ts](file:///d:/Veo3.Video.Auto-Windows-2.0.1-Setup/Veo3%20Video%20Auto/supabase_edge_function.ts))
A Deno-based Supabase Edge Function mimics the original backend logic:
- Always validates licenses (`/verify`, `/activate`).
- Always returns high-tier plan status (`plan: "VIP"`).
- Synthetic credit management (`total_credits: 999999`).

### Layer 3: Application Patching
- **[Patch_AppAsar.py](file:///d:/Veo3.Video.Auto-Windows-2.0.1-Setup/Veo3%20Video%20Auto/Patch_AppAsar.py):** A tool to directly modify the [app.asar](file:///d:/Veo3.Video.Auto-Windows-2.0.1-Setup/$PLUGINSDIR/resources/app.asar) bundle to point to new URLs or inject bypass logic.

## 3. License Enforcement Points

Enforcement is primarily based on the JSON response from the following REST endpoints:

| Endpoint | Logic |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/auth/login` | Determines initial user `tier` and `plan`. |
| `/account/info` | Gates specific features like `VIP_voice` and `eleven_v3`. |
| `/verify` | Global license validity check. |

### Verification of Success
- [x] Identified hardcoded credentials and backend URLs.
- [x] Reversed engineered the license verification JSON structure.
- [x] Located the source code for the custom bypass backend.
- [x] Confirmed the role of the local proxy launcher.
