# Task Checklist - Debugging VIP Status and Black Screen

- [ ] Analyze app source for more robust VIP bypass points
    - [ ] Search for `localStorage.getItem('currentUser')`
    - [ ] Search for `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(`
    - [ ] Look for functions that validate the subscription status
- [ ] Investigate potential overwriting of `currentUser`
    - [ ] Check Supabase login logic
    - [ ] Check if backend calls are forced on startup
- [ ] Debug the "Black Screen" (Loading Spinner)
    - [ ] Identify which API endpoint the app is stuck on
    - [ ] Search for dynamic URL construction (e.g., [.php](file:///d:/15012026kinx-auto/backend/login.php), `/api/`)
- [ ] Implement a more aggressive bypass
    - [ ] Patch the `getItem` method or the specific functions using it
- [ ] Verify fix with user
