# Hybrid Enterprise Bypass - Version 5 (Comprehensive)

The goal is to fully unlock the Enterprise tier, enable all "PRO" features, and prioritize using accounts from the "Cookie Management" section for API calls.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This patch replaces several key functions in both the main and renderer processes. It significantly modifies the application's authentication and authorization flow.

## Proposed Changes

### Main Process (main.js)
- **Fetch Interceptor**: Enhance the interceptor to:
    - Intercept `get_payment_settings.php` and inject Enterprise as the active package.
    - Ensure all user/profile related calls return `role: "Enterprise"` and a high-tier subscription.

### Renderer Process (index-DLxlB05E.js)
- **Feature Unlock**: 
    - Forced `isPro: true` and `disabled: false` for all sidebar items.
    - Change `Gb` (Personal tier marker) to a non-matching string to prevent accidental feature locking.
- **Cookie Prioritization**:
    - Modify `getSmartCookie` to search the `cookies` array from the app context and use the first valid one if the `activeCookie` is missing or invalid.
    - Bypass `getCookieFromServer` to avoid server-side validation failures for fake enterprise accounts.
- **Payment Modal Block**:
    - Patch the logic that opens the `PaymentModal` to do nothing or return `null`.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Verification script will check for the presence of the hybrid interceptor and the customized `getSmartCookie` logic.

### Manual Verification
- Launch the application.
- Verify sidebar items are all unlocked.
- Add an account to "Quản lý Cookie".
- Try generating a Thumbnail without a real Enterprise subscription on the main account.
- Verify that the app uses the managed cookie's token.
